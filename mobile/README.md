# README File for Mobile Ports

This directory contains projects to port the dxfeed.com libraries to mobile devices.

Notes on the build.

1. schemagen - use it to generate schema.
2. xjc - use it to generate the classes from the generated schema.

LIBRARIES

For some reason jmxtools is not found in maven, and the project hasn't been updated.
The library can be found here: https://repository.jboss.org/sun-jmx/1.2.8/lib/
And is downloaded in the libs directory.
